# Cloud Infrastructure Pipeline to Deploy a VPC on AWS

A cloud infrastructure pipeline automates the process of deploying, managing, and updating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS. This ensures consistency, repeatability, and efficiency in infrastructure management. Below are the steps involved in such a pipeline:

---

## **Key Steps**

### **1. Code Definition**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    - Define the VPC and its components (e.g., subnets, route tables, internet gateways) using an IaC language like HCL (Terraform) or YAML/JSON (CloudFormation).
    - Include details such as CIDR block configuration, subnet IP ranges, and other networking rules.

---

### **2. Version Control**
- Store the IaC scripts in a version control system (e.g., Git).
- Use branching strategies to isolate changes (e.g., feature branches, main branch).

---

### **3. Validation**
- **Code Linting:**
    - Use tools like `tflint` to validate the Terraform scripts for syntax and best practices.
- **Static Security Analysis:**
    - Use **`tfsec`** to scan Terraform code for potential security issues such as:
        - Publicly exposed sensitive resources.
        - Weak configurations in security groups or IAM roles.
        - Non-compliance with security best practices.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      tfsec .
      ```

---

### **4. CI/CD Integration**
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or AWS CodePipeline.

---

### **5. Infrastructure Plan (Dry Run)**
- Preview changes before applying them:
    - **Terraform:** Run `terraform plan` to see the proposed changes.
    - **CloudFormation:** Use `aws cloudformation validate-template` to ensure the template is valid.

---

### **6. Apply Changes to AWS**
- Apply the IaC scripts to deploy the VPC and associated resources:
    - **Terraform Example:**
      ```bash
      terraform apply
      ```
    - **CloudFormation Example:**
      ```bash
      aws cloudformation deploy
      ```

---

### **7. Provision VPC Components**
- The pipeline creates and configures:
    - **VPC:** Define the CIDR block for the private network.
    - **Subnets:** Create private and public subnets.
    - **Route Tables:** Associate subnets with the appropriate route tables.
    - **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Attach an IGW to the VPC for internet access.
    - **NAT Gateways:** Enable private subnets to access the internet while remaining inaccessible from outside.
    - **Security Groups:** Define inbound and outbound rules for resources within the VPC.

---

### **8. Post-Deployment Testing**
- Validate the deployment using automated tests:
    - **Network Tests:** Ensure correct CIDR blocks and routing configurations.
    - **Security Tests:** Validate that security groups and NACLs follow the principle of least privilege.
    - **Connectivity Tests:** Verify internet access for public subnets and no external access for private subnets.

---

### **9. Monitoring and Logging**
- Set up monitoring and logging for the VPC:
    - Enable **AWS CloudWatch Logs** for VPC flow logs to monitor traffic.
    - Integrate with **AWS Config** to ensure compliance with desired state configurations.

---

### **10. Notification**
- Send deployment notifications using tools like Slack, email, or Amazon SNS.

---

### **11. Rollback (Optional)**
- Include rollback mechanisms:
    - For Terraform, maintain a state file to revert changes.
    - For CloudFormation, use stack rollback in case of errors.

---

## **Pipeline Flow Example**

1. Developer pushes updated IaC code to the repository.
2. CI/CD pipeline triggers and validates the code.
3. **`tfsec`** scans the code for security vulnerabilities.
4. Pipeline generates a deployment plan and applies it to AWS.
5. Automated tests verify the infrastructure.
6. Monitoring and logging are enabled for the new VPC.
7. Notifications are sent upon successful deployment.

---

## **Benefits**
- **Automation:** Reduces manual setup and human errors.
- **Consistency:** Ensures infrastructure is deployed in a repeatable way.
- **Security:** Proactively identifies security risks with tools like `tfsec`.
- **Version Control:** Allows tracking and auditing of infrastructure changes.
- **Scalability:** Easily replicate the VPC in multiple environments or regions.
