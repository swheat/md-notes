# Does Azure VMware Solution Deploy Its Instances in Different Availability Zones?

No, **Azure VMware Solution (AVS)** does not currently deploy its instances across different **Availability Zones (AZs)** within a region.

---

## Key Details on Availability and Deployment for AVS:

### 1. Single Availability Zone Deployment
- AVS deploys all hosts for a cluster within a **single Availability Zone** in a region. This ensures low-latency connectivity and optimal performance for the VMware environment.
- While Azure itself offers multi-AZ deployments for high availability in many services, AVS is confined to a single AZ per cluster to maintain the integrity of the VMware solution and vSAN storage architecture.

---

### 2. High Availability at the Cluster Level
- High availability in AVS is achieved through **VMware's own features**, such as:
    - **vSphere High Availability (HA):** Ensures virtual machines are automatically restarted on other hosts in the cluster in case of a host failure.
    - **vSAN:** Provides redundancy for storage data within the cluster.

---

### 3. Disaster Recovery Options
- While AVS does not natively support multi-AZ deployments, you can enhance resilience by using:
    - **Azure Site Recovery:** For replicating VMs to another region.
    - **VMware HCX:** For workload mobility and disaster recovery to another AVS instance in a different Azure region.

---

### 4. Proximity Placement Groups
- AVS uses **Proximity Placement Groups** to ensure all cluster nodes are deployed within close proximity in the same AZ for consistent network latency.

---

### 5. Cross-Region Availability
- If cross-region resilience is required, you can deploy **separate AVS clusters in different regions** and use disaster recovery solutions, such as VMware SRM (Site Recovery Manager) or Azure Site Recovery.

---

## What About Regional Resiliency?
For critical workloads requiring **regional resiliency**, the recommended approach is:
- Deploying **separate AVS clusters in different regions** and configuring disaster recovery solutions for workload failover between regions.

# Description of VNETs and Subnets Needed for an AVS Cluster Deployment

When deploying an Azure VMware Solution (AVS) cluster with 3 servers, the following **virtual networks (VNETs)** and **subnets** are required:

---

## 1. **Azure Virtual Network (VNET)**
- **Purpose**: Acts as the boundary for all network traffic associated with the AVS cluster.
- **CIDR Block Recommendation**: Use a large address space (e.g., `/16`) to accommodate all subnets.

---

## 2. **Subnets Inside the VNET**

### **a. Management Subnet**
- **CIDR Block**: `10.0.0.0/24`.
- **Purpose**: Hosts AVS management components, including:
    - VMware vCenter.
    - NSX-T Manager.
    - Other management services.
- **Connectivity**: This subnet must be accessible from:
    - On-premises (via ExpressRoute).
    - Azure management tools.

### **b. Workload Subnet**
- **CIDR Block**: `10.0.1.0/24`.
- **Purpose**: Hosts application workloads (VMs running on AVS).
- **Connectivity**: Used for communication between the workloads and other Azure or on-premises resources.

### **c. vMotion Subnet (Optional)**
- **CIDR Block**: `10.0.2.0/24`.
- **Purpose**: Handles VMware-specific traffic, such as vMotion for VM migration between hosts.
- **Connectivity**: Internal to the AVS cluster.

---

## 3. **ExpressRoute**
- **Purpose**: Connects on-premises network to Azure.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Allows on-premises access to the Management Subnet for managing AVS.
    - Enables seamless integration between workloads in the AVS cluster and on-premises applications.
