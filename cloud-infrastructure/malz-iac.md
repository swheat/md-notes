Setting Up a Multi-Account AWS Landing Zone and Deploying Cloud-Based Infrastructure

1. AWS Landing Zone Setup

A multi-account AWS landing zone establishes a secure, scalable, and compliant environment for managing multiple AWS accounts. Using tools like AWS Control Tower or custom frameworks, follow these steps:
1.	Account Structure:
•	Root Account: Central management account for billing and governance.
•	Organizational Units (OUs):
•	Security OU: Centralized logging, audit, and security accounts.
•	Sandbox/Dev OU: Developer-focused accounts for testing.
•	Test OU: Staging environment for pre-production validation.
•	Prod OU: Production accounts for live workloads.
2.	Control Policies and Guardrails:
•	Implement Service Control Policies (SCPs) to restrict unauthorized actions across accounts.
•	Set up logging with AWS CloudTrail and centralized monitoring using AWS Security Hub and Amazon GuardDuty.
3.	Networking:
•	Deploy shared VPCs, transit gateways, and subnets for consistent networking.
•	Use AWS IAM for identity federation and role-based access across accounts.

2. Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform

Terraform is used to manage AWS resources as code.
1.	Terraform Modules:
•	Create reusable modules for resources (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS) and security policies.
•	Use remote state backends (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking) for state management.
2.	Environment-Specific Workspaces:
•	Define separate workspaces for dev, test, and prod.
•	Use terraform.tfvars files to store environment-specific configurations.
3.	IAM and Resource Access:
•	Use Terraform AWS Provider to configure cross-account roles and permissions.
•	Ensure each account has isolated resources with centralized control.
4.	Code Deployment Workflow:
•	Use Terraform scripts in the GitHub repository.
•	Integrate tfsec for security analysis of Terraform configurations.

3. Pipeline Setup with GitHub and GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions automates the deployment pipeline.
1.	Pipeline Stages:
•	Linting and Testing:
•	Run terraform fmt for code formatting.
•	Run terraform validate to check configuration validity.
•	Execute tfsec for security compliance checks.
•	Plan: Generate a Terraform plan for review.
•	Approval: Require manual approval before applying changes.
•	Deploy: Apply changes to the target environment.
2.	GitHub Actions Workflow Example:

name: Terraform CI/CD

on:
push:
branches:
- main
- dev
- test
- prod

jobs:
terraform:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.5.0

      - name: Initialize Terraform
        run: terraform init -backend-config="key=${{ github.ref }}.tfstate"

      - name: Terraform Validate
        run: terraform validate

      - name: Run tfsec
        run: tfsec .

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan -out=tfplan

      - name: Apply (manual approval required)
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/prod'
        run: terraform apply tfplan

4. Code Promotion Process

Promote code through structured environments (dev -> test -> prod):
1.	Development Environment:
•	Developers test configurations in the dev account.
•	Use isolated state files for dev to prevent accidental production changes.
2.	Test Environment:
•	Changes are promoted to the test environment through a pull request or merging into the test branch.
•	Run automated tests (e.g., infrastructure, security, integration).
3.	Production Environment:
•	After validation, manually approve changes for deployment to production.
•	Use GitHub Actions to apply changes to the production workspace.

5. Roles and Responsibilities

Developer Role:

	•	Code Management:
	•	Write and test Terraform configurations.
	•	Ensure code adheres to formatting, best practices, and security standards.
	•	Pipeline Contribution:
	•	Collaborate on CI/CD workflows and address pipeline issues.
	•	Use dev accounts for experimentation and validation.
	•	Security Awareness:
	•	Adhere to security guidelines during development (e.g., tfsec findings).

SecOps Role:

	•	Security Oversight:
	•	Review SCPs, IAM roles, and guardrails for compliance.
	•	Monitor tfsec reports and resolve security vulnerabilities.
	•	Infrastructure Validation:
	•	Validate configurations for compliance before approving promotion to prod.
	•	Ensure logging and monitoring are in place for deployed resources.
	•	Incident Management:
	•	Investigate security alerts or compliance violations.
	•	Perform periodic audits of environments and pipelines.

This approach ensures a secure, scalable, and compliant cloud environment managed collaboratively by development and SecOps teams.
