Having separate repositories for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and the application code is a common practice in software development and DevOps. This separation helps maintain clarity, modularity, and operational efficiency, especially in environments with distinct roles and workflows for infrastructure and application teams. Here are the key reasons for this approach:

1. Separation of Concerns

   •	Infrastructure Repository:
   •	Focuses on defining, provisioning, and managing infrastructure resources (e.g., Terraform scripts, AWS CloudFormation templates).
   •	Contains configurations for networking, security, storage, compute, etc.
   •	Application Repository:
   •	Contains the source code for the application, business logic, and associated tests.
   •	Includes frameworks, libraries, and dependencies for building and running the application.

This clear separation ensures that changes in one domain (e.g., application code) do not unintentionally affect the other (e.g., infrastructure configurations).

2. Simplified Role-Based Collaboration

   •	Developers:
   •	Focus on the application repository, iterating on code, features, and functionality.
   •	Use a stable infrastructure layer provided by the IaC repository.
   •	DevOps/SecOps Teams:
   •	Manage the infrastructure repository, ensuring the environment is secure, compliant, and performant.
   •	Can work independently without interfering with application development workflows.

3. Independent Lifecycles

   •	Infrastructure Updates:
   •	Infrastructure often requires updates less frequently than the application code.
   •	Changes to infrastructure (e.g., scaling an environment, adding a new resource) typically follow a more controlled and slower release cycle.
   •	Application Updates:
   •	Applications undergo frequent iterations with rapid development, testing, and deployment cycles.

Decoupling the repositories allows each lifecycle to proceed independently without blocking or complicating the other.

4. Version Control and Rollbacks

   •	Independent repositories make it easier to:
   •	Maintain separate version histories for infrastructure and application changes.
   •	Roll back changes to infrastructure or application independently in case of errors.
   •	Reduce the risk of merge conflicts caused by unrelated updates.

5. Modular and Reusable Code

   •	Infrastructure Repository:
   •	Encourages the development of reusable infrastructure modules (e.g., Terraform modules) that can be shared across multiple applications or environments.
   •	Ensures that infrastructure can be treated as a common service or utility.
   •	Application Repository:
   •	Keeps the application-focused code lightweight and modular, making it easier to test and deploy.

6. Simplified CI/CD Pipelines

   •	Separate repositories allow for distinct CI/CD pipelines tailored to the needs of each domain:
   •	Infrastructure Pipeline:
   •	Validate and test IaC (e.g., terraform plan, tfsec).
   •	Deploy infrastructure changes through controlled environments (e.g., dev → test → prod).
   •	Application Pipeline:
   •	Build, test, and deploy the application independently of infrastructure updates.

This separation reduces complexity and potential cross-dependencies in the automation workflow.

7. Security and Compliance

   •	Access Control:
   •	Infrastructure repositories often require stricter access controls to limit who can provision or modify critical resources.
   •	Application repositories may have broader access for developers to facilitate feature development.
   •	Audit Trails:
   •	Keeping infrastructure changes isolated in a dedicated repository simplifies auditing and compliance reporting for infrastructure-specific modifications.

8. Scalability

   •	As teams and projects grow, keeping IaC and application code in separate repositories avoids bloated, monolithic repositories that become harder to maintain and navigate.
   •	Multiple applications can share a single infrastructure repository, enabling consistent infrastructure standards across projects.

9. Flexibility in Tools and Technologies

   •	Infrastructure Repo: May use tools like Terraform, AWS CDK, or Ansible.
   •	Application Repo: May use completely different technologies and frameworks (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java).

By separating repositories, teams can optimize their workflows and toolchains for the specific requirements of infrastructure and application development.

When Might You Combine Repos?

While separation is beneficial, there are scenarios where combining IaC and application code in a single repository might be appropriate:
•	Tightly Coupled Infrastructure and Applications: If the infrastructure is specific to a single application (e.g., serverless architecture with AWS Lambda).
•	Small Teams or Projects: In smaller setups, maintaining one repository simplifies management.
•	Monorepos: In some organizations, monorepos (single repositories for all code) are used to consolidate management and enable holistic testing/deployment workflows.

Conclusion

Using separate repositories for IaC and application code promotes modularity, clarity, and scalability. It enables independent development and deployment workflows, simplifies role-based collaboration, and ensures better alignment with security and compliance practices. While combining repositories may work for smaller or highly integrated projects, maintaining separate repositories is the best practice in most professional environments.
