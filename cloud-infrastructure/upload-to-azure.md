# How to Upload a File to an Azure Storage Account and Container as a Blob Data Contributor or Blob Data Owner

As a **Blob Data Contributor** or **Blob Data Owner**, you have permissions to upload files to an Azure Storage Account's blob container. Here's how to do it step by step.

---

## **Using Azure Portal**

1. **Log in to the Azure Portal**:
    - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. **Navigate to the Storage Account**:
    - Find and open the storage account where the blob container is hosted.

3. **Open the Blob Container**:
    - Under the **Data Storage** section, click **Containers**.
    - Select the blob container where you want to upload the file.

4. **Upload the File**:
    - Click the **Upload** button at the top.
    - In the **Upload blob** dialog:
        - **Browse for files** to select the file from your local machine.
        - Set additional options like blob type (Block Blob, Page Blob, or Append Blob) if needed.
    - Click **Upload**.

## **Using Azure CLI**

1. **Install Azure CLI** (if not already installed):
    - Follow the [Azure CLI Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

2. **Log in to Azure CLI**:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```
### 3. **Upload the File**

- Use the `Set-AzStorageBlobContent` cmdlet:
  ```powershell
  Set-AzStorageBlobContent `
    -File "C:\path\to\file.txt" `
    -Container "mycontainer" `
    -Blob "file.txt" `
    -Context (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "mystorageaccount").Context
  ```

- Replace:
    - `"C:\path\to\file.txt"`: The file's path on your local machine.
    - `"mycontainer"`: The name of the blob container.
    - `"file.txt"`: The name you want the blob to have in the container.
    - `"mystorageaccount"`: The storage account name.
    - `"myresourcegroup"`: The resource group containing your storage account.

## **Using Code (Python SDK Example)**

1. **Install Azure SDK**:
   ```bash
   pip install azure-storage-blob
   ```

2.	Upload the File:

from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

# Connection details
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string("<connection-string>")
container_name = "mycontainer"
blob_name = "myfile.txt"
file_path = "path/to/myfile.txt"

# Upload the file
blob_client = blob_service_client.get_blob_client(container=container_name, blob=blob_name)
with open(file_path, "rb") as data:
blob_client.upload_blob(data, overwrite=True)
print(f"{blob_name} uploaded to container {container_name}.")
- 
- Replace:
    - `<connection-string>`: Your Azure Storage Account connection string.
    - `container_name`: The name of the blob container where you want to upload the file.
    - `blob_name`: The desired name for the blob in the container.
    - `file_path`: The local path to the file you want to upload.

## **Important Notes**

1. **Permissions**:
    - **Blob Data Contributor** and **Blob Data Owner** roles grant permissions to upload files.
    - If you encounter permission issues, verify your role assignment in the **Access Control (IAM)** section of the storage account.

2. **Blob Types**:
    - Files are uploaded as **Block Blobs** by default. You can specify **Page Blob** or **Append Blob** if required.

3. **Access Control**:
    - Use **Azure AD Authentication** (`--auth-mode login` for CLI/SDK) for role-based access.
    - For SDK or PowerShell, you can also use a **connection string** or **Azure Identity credentials**.

4. **Handling Large Files**:
    - For files larger than 200 GB, consider using **Azure Storage Large File Upload** APIs or tools.
