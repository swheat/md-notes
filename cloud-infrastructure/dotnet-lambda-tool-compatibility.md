# Summary of .NET Version Compatibility with AWS Lambda Tool


The AWS Lambda .NET Core tools, particularly `Amazon.Lambda.Tools`, support various .NET versions based on AWS Lambda's runtime support and the tool's updates. 

# AWS Lambda Deployment Tool for .NET

The **AWS Lambda Deployment Tool for .NET** is a command-line interface (CLI) utility provided by AWS to streamline the deployment and management of .NET applications on AWS Lambda. It simplifies packaging, deployment, and configuration of .NET-based serverless applications, enabling developers to focus on code rather than operational complexities.

## Key Features

1. **Simplified Deployment**:
    - Automatically packages .NET projects into a zip file compatible with AWS Lambda.
    - Configures Lambda function settings during deployment, such as runtime, memory, and timeout.

2. **Integration with AWS Services**:
    - Provides seamless integration with other AWS services like API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3 for full-stack serverless applications.

3. **Support for Various .NET Versions**:
    - Compatible with .NET Core and .NET 6/7/8 for custom runtimes.

4. **Customizable Deployment Process**:
    - Supports configuration of IAM roles, environment variables, and function parameters directly from the CLI.

5. **Automatic CloudFormation Template Generation**:
    - Generates a CloudFormation template to define and manage your serverless application's infrastructure as code.

Below is a summary of compatibility:

## Supported .NET Versions

### .NET 6
- **Status:** Fully supported with AWS Lambda.
- **Runtime Identifier:** `dotnet6`.
- **Details:**
    - AWS Lambda officially supports .NET 6 as a managed runtime.
    - Compatible with `Amazon.Lambda.Tools` versions 5.x and above.

### .NET 7
- **Status:** Supported **only** for custom runtime.
- **Runtime Identifier:** `dotnet7` (requires custom runtime setup).
- **Details:**
    - AWS Lambda does not offer a managed runtime for .NET 7.
    - Applications can be deployed using a custom runtime layer with `Amazon.Lambda.RuntimeSupport`.

### .NET 8
- **Status:** Depends on AWS support updates.
- **Details:**
    - Preview versions may work with custom runtimes (no managed runtime available as of now).
    - Use custom runtimes or containers for deploying .NET 8 applications.

## Key Notes
- **Managed Runtimes:** Provided for **LTS (Long-Term Support)** .NET versions like .NET 6.
- **Non-LTS Versions:** Versions such as .NET 7 and newer pre-LTS versions require:
    - A custom runtime using `Amazon.Lambda.RuntimeSupport`.
    - Or container-based deployment.

## AWS Lambda Tools Version Requirements
- **Recommended Version:** `Amazon.Lambda.Tools` version 5.0+ for .NET 6 and later.
- **Install or Update:**
  ```bash
  dotnet tool install -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools
  dotnet tool update -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools
  ```
## Custom Runtime Deployment

For .NET versions not directly supported by AWS Lambda:

1. **Use the `Amazon.Lambda.RuntimeSupport` NuGet Package**:
    - Add the `Amazon.Lambda.RuntimeSupport` NuGet package to your project to enable compatibility with custom runtimes.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      dotnet add package Amazon.Lambda.RuntimeSupport
      ```

2. **Package Your Application**:
    - Compile your .NET application as a self-contained deployment.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained
      ```

3. **Create a Custom Bootstrap Script**:
    - Write a `bootstrap` script to invoke your .NET application.
    - The script should look something like this:
      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash
      ./MyDotNetApp
      ```

4. **Bundle Your Application**:
    - Package your application, bootstrap script, and dependencies into a zip file.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      zip -r my-function.zip bootstrap MyDotNetApp*
      ```

5. **Deploy Using AWS CLI or Lambda Management Console**:
    - Use the AWS CLI or Lambda Console to upload the zip package.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      aws lambda create-function \
        --function-name my-dotnet-function \
        --runtime provided.al2 \
        --role <execution-role-arn> \
        --handler bootstrap \
        --zip-file fileb://my-function.zip
      ```

6. **Set the Runtime to `provided.al2`**:
    - Since .NET versions beyond AWS managed runtimes require custom runtime, set the runtime as `provided.al2`.
