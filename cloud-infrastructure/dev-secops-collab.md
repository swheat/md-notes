Collaboration between developers and SecOps teams is crucial when promoting infrastructure as code (IaC) through environments (dev -> test -> prod). A well-defined workflow ensures security, compliance, and reliability while enabling developers to move quickly. Here’s how the two teams can share responsibilities and collaborate effectively:

1. Shared Responsibilities and Alignment

1.1. Define Clear Goals and Expectations

	•	Developers focus on creating and iterating IaC that meets business needs.
	•	SecOps ensures that infrastructure adheres to security, compliance, and operational standards.
	•	Both teams must align on:
	•	Security policies (e.g., identity, access management).
	•	Deployment guardrails (e.g., AWS Service Control Policies).
	•	Shared tools and workflows for testing, validation, and monitoring.

1.2. Use a Common Set of Tools

	•	Use a shared stack for collaboration, including:
	•	Version Control: GitHub (or similar) to store and review IaC.
	•	CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions, Terraform Cloud, or Jenkins for pipeline automation.
	•	Static Analysis: Tools like tfsec, Checkov, or Trivy for IaC security checks.
	•	Secrets Management: Vaults like AWS Secrets Manager for handling sensitive data.

2. Collaborative Workflow for Promoting IaC

2.1. Development Phase (Dev Environment)

	•	Developers:
	•	Write Terraform or other IaC in a feature branch.
	•	Test configurations locally or in a sandbox/dev account.
	•	Run automated checks like:
	•	terraform fmt and terraform validate for syntax and validity.
	•	tfsec to identify IaC vulnerabilities.
	•	Unit tests for modular Terraform components.
	•	SecOps:
	•	Provide pre-approved templates or modules for developers to use (e.g., VPC, IAM roles).
	•	Review the sandbox environment for adherence to baseline security standards.
	•	Suggest improvements or enforce best practices for logging, monitoring, and encryption.

2.2. Pull Request Review

	•	Developers open a pull request to merge code from dev to test.
	•	Both teams participate in a pull request review:
	•	Developers:
	•	Explain the purpose of the code and highlight any changes to existing infrastructure.
	•	SecOps:
	•	Review the code for security compliance and validate the terraform plan output for unintended changes.
	•	Ensure sensitive variables (e.g., credentials) are stored securely.

2.3. Test Environment

	•	Developers:
	•	Deploy IaC to the test environment through an automated CI/CD pipeline.
	•	Run integration tests to ensure the new infrastructure works with existing systems.
	•	Monitor for errors or misconfigurations.
	•	SecOps:
	•	Validate the infrastructure against organization policies, including:
	•	Resource tagging and cost optimization.
	•	Proper IAM role configurations and least privilege access.
	•	Simulate disaster scenarios or edge cases (e.g., failover tests).
	•	Monitor for security vulnerabilities and configuration drift.

2.4. Promotion to Production

	•	Developers request approval for deployment to production.
	•	Both teams participate in a production readiness review:
	•	Developers:
	•	Confirm the code has passed all tests and reviews.
	•	Provide a rollback plan in case of issues post-deployment.
	•	SecOps:
	•	Verify security, compliance, and operational requirements (e.g., logging, monitoring).
	•	Approve deployment in GitHub Actions or Terraform Cloud.

3. Communication and Collaboration Practices

3.1. Shared Governance

	•	Infrastructure Standards: Develop a set of reusable Terraform modules and ensure all developers adhere to them.
	•	Code of Conduct for IaC: Define how changes should be tested, reviewed, and documented.
	•	Runbooks: Create shared runbooks for troubleshooting and incident response.

3.2. Regular Syncs

	•	Conduct regular meetings between developers and SecOps to:
	•	Review recent deployments.
	•	Discuss challenges or incidents.
	•	Plan improvements to pipelines and workflows.

3.3. Incident Handling

	•	Both teams share responsibility for incident response:
	•	Developers address functionality-related issues in infrastructure.
	•	SecOps mitigates security incidents and compliance breaches.

3.4. Feedback Loops

	•	Use post-deployment retrospectives to identify:
	•	What went well in the promotion process.
	•	Areas for improvement in code, processes, or pipelines.

4. Pipeline Design for Collaboration

4.1. Automated CI/CD Workflow

Both teams rely on a robust pipeline that supports collaboration:
1.	Code Push: Developers push IaC to a feature branch.
2.	Static Analysis: Tools like tfsec and terraform validate run automatically.
3.	Plan Generation: Terraform generates a plan for review.
4.	Review Stage:
•	Developers and SecOps review the plan collaboratively.
5.	Test Deployment:
•	Code is applied to the test environment after approval.
6.	Approval for Production:
•	Manual approval from SecOps is required before deploying to production.
7.	Production Deployment:
•	Terraform applies changes to production using automated pipelines.

4.2. Monitoring and Feedback

	•	Developers: Monitor infrastructure performance post-deployment.
	•	SecOps: Monitor for security alerts, drift, and compliance violations.

5. Shared Responsibility Matrix

Task	Developers	SecOps
Write and test IaC	Create and test Terraform modules.	Provide pre-approved modules and policies.
Code review	Review for functionality and efficiency.	Review for security and compliance.
Deploy to dev/test	Deploy using CI/CD pipelines.	Validate security configurations.
Approve production changes	Request promotion to production.	Perform security audits and approve.
Monitor infrastructure	Identify performance or functional issues.	Monitor security and compliance violations.
Incident response	Fix functional issues in IaC.	Address security incidents and compliance risks.

Conclusion

By clearly defining responsibilities and fostering collaboration, developers and SecOps teams can work together to securely and efficiently promote IaC through environments. Shared tools, automated pipelines, and regular communication ensure alignment and streamline the process.
