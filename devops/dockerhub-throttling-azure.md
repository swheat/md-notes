### DockerHub Rate Limits and Azure Workarounds

DockerHub implemented **rate limits** for public (unauthenticated) pulls in November 2020, which can throttle public access, including from Azure. The limits are as follows:

- **Unauthenticated users**: 100 pulls per 6 hours per IP address.
- **Authenticated users**: 200 pulls per 6 hours per user.
- **Pro accounts and higher**: Unlimited pulls.

Azure services that rely on public DockerHub images, such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Instances (ACI), might experience throttling if many instances or nodes are pulling images.

### **Workarounds for DockerHub Rate Limits**

#### 1. **Authenticate with DockerHub**
Authenticate to DockerHub in your environment to benefit from higher pull limits. Use a personal access token (preferred) or a username/password to log in.

**Example (Azure CLI or scripts):**
```bash
docker login --username <DOCKER_USERNAME> --password <DOCKER_PASSWORD>
```
### Example in Terraform or CI/CD pipelines:
- Add DockerHub credentials as environment variables or secrets.
- Use the credentials to log in before pulling images.

---

#### 2. **Use Azure Container Registry (ACR)**
Mirror the DockerHub images you need to an Azure Container Registry (ACR). This avoids pulling directly from DockerHub. You can configure ACR tasks to automatically mirror and update images from DockerHub.

**Steps to Mirror a DockerHub Image to ACR:**
```bash
az acr import --name <ACR_NAME> --source docker.io/library/nginx:latest --image nginx:latest
```
Replace `docker.io/library/nginx:latest` with the image you want to mirror.

---

#### 3. **Use a Different Public Registry**
Consider using other public container registries that mirror DockerHub content, such as:
- **Google Container Registry (GCR)**
- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public (ECR Public)**
- **Quay.io**

---

#### 4. **Cache Images Locally**
Pre-pull DockerHub images and cache them locally or within your cluster.

**In Kubernetes:**
- Use an internal container registry (e.g., ACR) or deploy a pull-through cache like Harbor or Nexus within your cluster.

---

#### 5. **Upgrade to a Paid DockerHub Plan**
DockerHub Pro and Team accounts have higher or unlimited pull limits. This may be cost-effective if your organization relies heavily on DockerHub.

---

### **Recommended Best Practices**
- **For Kubernetes Deployments**:  
  Use ACR or another private registry to ensure reliability and reduce latency.

- **For CI/CD Pipelines**:  
  Authenticate with DockerHub or use a mirrored image in a private registry like ACR.
