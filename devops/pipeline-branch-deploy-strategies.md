# Approaches for Deploying to Different Environments with Terraform and GitHub Actions

Here are several approaches for deploying infrastructure to different environments with **Terraform** and a **GitHub Actions pipeline**, along with their **pros** and **cons**:

---

## 1. Use Separate Branches for Each Environment
- **How it works**:  
  Each environment (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) has its own branch. When code is committed or merged into a branch, it triggers a deployment for that specific environment.

### Pros
- Clear separation between environments.
- Easy to implement in GitHub Actions with branch-based triggers.
- Minimal risk of accidental deployment to the wrong environment.

### Cons
- Managing multiple branches can become complex.
- Duplicates configuration across branches, leading to potential drift.
- May require additional steps to keep environment branches in sync with shared configuration changes.

---

## 2. Use a Single Branch with Workflow Inputs
- **How it works**:  
  Use a single branch (e.g., `main`) and a manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`) or environment variable to specify the target environment. The pipeline uses the specified environment to apply Terraform changes.

### Pros
- Centralized configuration and workflow, reducing duplication.
- Easy to control and deploy to any environment on demand.
- Simplifies branch management.

### Cons
- Increased risk of human error when specifying the target environment.
- Requires robust access control to ensure sensitive environments like `prod` are protected.

---

## 3. Use Separate Terraform Workspaces
- **How it works**:  
  Each environment corresponds to a separate Terraform workspace (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`). The pipeline switches workspaces using `terraform workspace select` before running commands.

### Pros
- Allows reusing the same Terraform codebase across environments.
- Simplifies management of environment-specific state.
- Reduces code duplication since the configuration is shared.

### Cons
- Workspace management can become complex for larger teams.
- Requires explicit handling of environment-specific variables.
- Does not inherently prevent cross-environment resource dependencies.

---

## 4. Use Environment-Specific Terraform Variables
- **How it works**:  
  A single Terraform configuration is parameterized with variables for each environment. The pipeline uses environment-specific `.tfvars` files or `-var` flags during `terraform apply`.

### Pros
- Centralized codebase, making it easier to maintain and update.
- Allows flexibility to customize resources for each environment via variables.
- Reduces duplication compared to branch-based approaches.

### Cons
- Requires careful variable management to avoid misconfiguration.
- Potentially error-prone if variables are incorrectly applied to an environment.

---

## 5. Use Separate Terraform State Backends
- **How it works**:  
  Each environment has a dedicated Terraform backend for its state (e.g., separate S3 buckets or remote workspaces). The pipeline dynamically configures the backend based on the target environment.

### Pros
- Strong isolation of environment states.
- Prevents accidental overwrites of resources between environments.
- Centralized codebase with consistent configuration.

### Cons
- Backend configuration can become complex to manage dynamically.
- Requires robust access control to protect sensitive environment backends.

---

## 6. Use Environment Folders in a Monorepo
- **How it works**:  
  The repository contains a folder for each environment (e.g., `environments/dev`, `environments/prod`). Each folder contains the environment-specific Terraform configuration or `.tfvars`.

### Pros
- Easy to visualize and navigate environment-specific configurations.
- Allows fine-grained customization for each environment.
- Clear separation of environment resources and variables.

### Cons
- Duplicates some configuration, leading to potential drift.
- Requires additional effort to ensure shared modules or configuration are consistent across folders.

---

## 7. Use GitHub Environments
- **How it works**:  
  Define GitHub environments (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) with approval workflows for sensitive environments. Use GitHub environment protection rules to require manual approvals for production deployments.

### Pros
- Built-in support for approvals and access control in GitHub.
- Reduces the risk of accidental production deployments.
- Simple to integrate with existing GitHub Actions workflows.

### Cons
- Limited to GitHub's environment features.
- Still requires separate handling of Terraform state and variables.

## Comparison of Approaches

| Approach                           | Pros                                                                 | Cons                                                             | Best For                                    |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Separate Branches**              | Clear separation of environments, simple to trigger.                | Complex branch management, duplicate configuration.              | Teams with clear branch-based workflows.   |
| **Single Branch with Inputs**      | Centralized configuration, flexible deployments.                    | Risk of human error, requires strong access controls.            | Agile teams with dynamic deployment needs. |
| **Separate Workspaces**            | Reusable codebase, simplified state management.                     | Workspace management complexity, variable handling overhead.     | Small to medium projects with isolation.   |
| **Environment-Specific Variables** | Centralized codebase, flexible resource customization.              | Error-prone variable management.                                | Teams familiar with parameterized workflows. |
| **Separate Terraform State Backends** | Strong isolation, prevents state overwrites.                        | Dynamic backend management complexity.                          | Critical or sensitive deployments.         |
| **Environment Folders**            | Clear structure, easy to customize.                                 | Potential duplication and drift.                                | Large projects needing extensive customization. |
| **GitHub Environments**            | Built-in approvals and access control.                              | Limited customization for Terraform-specific workflows.          | Organizations requiring strict governance.  |

## Best Practices
- **For small teams**: Use a single branch with inputs or separate Terraform workspaces.
- **For large teams or enterprises**: Use GitHub environments or separate backends for robust isolation and access control.
- **For clear visibility**: Use environment-specific folders in a monorepo.
