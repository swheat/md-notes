### **Step 1: Describe Existing Integrations**
- ERP system maintains authoritative personnel records.
- LMS has a separate user management system but requires real-time updates.
- Directory Server is responsible for authentication and authorization.

### **Step 2: Describe Data Involved in Proposed Integrations**
- **ERP System:** Employee/Student ID, Name, Department, Role, Email, Status
- **LMS:** User ID, Course Enrollment, Access Permissions
- **Directory Server:** Username, Email, Group Memberships

### **Step 3: Describe the Flow of Data in the Proposed Integrations**
1. ERP system triggers a **Create-Sync** message when a new person record is created.
2. OpenEAI Middleware captures the event and routes it to the LMS and Directory Server.
3. LMS consumes the message and provisions a user account.
4. Directory Server updates group memberships for authentication.
5. Confirmation messages are sent back to the ERP system.

### **Step 4: List Existing and New Enterprise Data Objects Required for the Integrations**
- Existing: `BasicPerson`, `InstitutionalIdentity`
- New: `LMSUser`, `DirectoryUser`

### **Step 5: Name the Messages that will be used to Implement the Integrations**
- `com.erp.Person.BasicPerson.Create-Sync`
- `com.erp.Person.BasicPerson.Update-Sync`
- `com.erp.Person.BasicPerson.Delete-Sync`

### **Step 6: Name the Existing and New Messaging Applications Required**
- **Existing:** OpenEAI Core Messaging Engine
- **New:** ERP Sync Gateway, LMS Gateway, Directory Sync Gateway

### **Step 7: Provide Technical Stories for the Primary Application**
- When an employee/student is created in ERP, a `Create-Sync` message is published.
- The LMS and Directory Server consume the message and provision accounts accordingly.

### **Step 8: Provide Technical Stories for the Other Applications Named in the Template**
- LMS subscribes to `BasicPerson.Create-Sync` and provisions new users.
- Directory Server subscribes to `BasicPerson.Create-Sync` to update authentication records.
- Both systems acknowledge processing via a response message.

### **Step 9: Summarize all Outstanding Questions, Issues, and Action Items**
- Ensure security compliance in data transmission.
- Establish error-handling mechanisms.
- Define retry policies for failed messages.

### **Step 10: Perform Work Estimation and Scheduling**
- ERP Sync Gateway: 100 hours
- LMS Gateway: 120 hours
- Directory Sync Gateway: 80 hours
- Testing & Deployment: 100 hours

### **Step 11: Functional Approval of Analysis, Scope, and Scheduling**
Approved by project stakeholders on **March 20, 2025**.

### **Step 12: Initiate Template Change Control Processes**
- All changes to be reviewed and approved by Integration Team Lead.

### **Step 13: Provide Testing Specifications**
- Functional tests: User creation, updates, and deletions.
- Performance tests: Handling 1000 transactions per minute.
- Security tests: Verify access controls and encryption.

### **Step 14: Develop and Test Integrations**
- Code development for the three gateways.
- Continuous integration setup.
- Automated testing framework.

### **Step 15: Prepare Implementation and Rollout Plan**
- Staging deployment in **July 2025**.
- Production go-live in **August 2025**.

### **Step 16: Implement in Production**
- Deploy final integration.
- Monitor live transactions.
- Address post-deployment issues.
