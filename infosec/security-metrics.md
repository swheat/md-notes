# üöÄ Common Security Metrics Tracked by Organizations

Organizations track **security metrics** to measure **risk, effectiveness of security controls, compliance, and incident response**. These metrics are reported to **senior leadership, CISOs, and boards** to make informed decisions about security investments and risk management.
