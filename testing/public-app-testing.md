# Making Web Applications Available to Testers Without Public Internet Access

Organizations can make web applications available to testers while keeping them inaccessible to the broader internet by using various techniques to restrict access. These approaches balance the need for testers to access the application with the need for security and control over who can interact with the application.

## **Common Approaches to Restrict Web Application Access**

### 1. **IP Whitelisting**
- **How It Works**:
    - Restrict access to the application to specific IP addresses or IP ranges, such as the testers' office network, VPN, or cloud-based test environments.
- **Best For**:
    - Internal teams or testers with fixed IPs or VPN access.
- **Limitations**:
    - Not ideal for geographically distributed testers or testers with dynamic IPs.

---

### 2. **Basic Authentication**
- **How It Works**:
    - Add a simple username and password requirement at the web server or application level, even for unauthenticated public pages.
- **Best For**:
    - Quick, lightweight access control for small groups of testers.
- **Limitations**:
    - Less secure than other methods and unsuitable for production-like environments.

---

### 3. **Staging Environment with VPN**
- **How It Works**:
    - Host the application in a staging environment behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
    - Testers connect to the VPN to access the staging environment.
- **Best For**:
    - Highly secure environments and distributed testing teams.
- **Limitations**:
    - Requires VPN configuration and management, which adds complexity.

### 4. **Access via Reverse Proxy**
- **How It Works**:
    - Use a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB, or Cloudflare) to restrict access based on rules like IP, headers, or authentication.
- **Best For**:
    - Flexible and programmable access control.
- **Limitations**:
    - Requires technical expertise for configuration.

---

### 5. **Access Tokens in URLs**
- **How It Works**:
    - Require a unique token to be appended to the URL for accessing the application.
    - Example: `https://app.example.com/?access_token=abc123`.
- **Best For**:
    - Temporary or lightweight access control.
- **Limitations**:
    - Tokens can be accidentally shared, leading to unauthorized access.

---

### 6. **Temporary Domain or Subdomain**
- **How It Works**:
    - Host the application on a temporary domain or subdomain that is not indexed or publicly advertised.
- **Best For**:
    - Isolating the testing environment from production.
- **Limitations**:
    - If the domain is not further secured, determined attackers might find it.

---

### 7. **Firewall with Geo-Restrictions**
- **How It Works**:
    - Restrict access based on geographic location using a web application firewall (WAF) or CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS WAF).
- **Best For**:
    - Geographically limited testing groups.
- **Limitations**:
    - Testers outside the permitted locations will need additional configurations.

---

### 8. **OAuth or SSO for Tester Access**
- **How It Works**:
    - Require testers to log in using a single sign-on (SSO) or OAuth provider.
- **Best For**:
    - Teams with established identity management systems.
- **Limitations**:
    - Requires testers to have valid accounts in the identity system.

---

### 9. **Time-Bound or One-Time Use Links**
- **How It Works**:
    - Provide testers with unique links that expire after a set period or single use.
- **Best For**:
    - Temporary or one-off testing scenarios.
- **Limitations**:
    - Requires link generation and management.

---

### 10. **Serverless Preview Deployments**
- **How It Works**:
    - Use serverless platforms to spin up preview environments for specific branches or pull requests (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify).
- **Best For**:
    - Testing feature branches or isolated functionality.
- **Limitations**:
    - May not support complex backend systems.

---

## **Recommended Approach for Applications with Unauthenticated Functionality**

For web applications with unauthenticated flows, **IP whitelisting combined with Basic Authentication** or **VPN-based staging environments** are good options. If your team is distributed, consider using **OAuth/SSO-based access control** or **time-bound links** for flexibility.
