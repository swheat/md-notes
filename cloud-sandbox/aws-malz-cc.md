# Setting Up a Multi-Account Landing Zone with AWS Control Tower for AWS Sandbox Accounts

AWS Control Tower simplifies the setup and governance of a secure, multi-account environment. This process uses best practices to establish a landing zone and create sandbox accounts for development or testing.

---

## **Steps to Set Up a Multi-Account Landing Zone**

### **1. Prerequisites**
Before starting, ensure:
- **Administrative Access**: You have administrative permissions to the AWS Management Console.
- **Billing and Permissions**: Your AWS account has billing permissions and is configured for multi-account management.
- **Region Selection**: Control Tower operates in supported AWS regions. Ensure the selected region is supported.

---

### **2. Enable AWS Organizations**
Control Tower requires AWS Organizations for multi-account management.

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigate to **AWS Organizations**.
3. Enable **All Features** if not already enabled.
4. Configure an Organizational Unit (OU) structure for grouping accounts, such as:
    - `Sandbox`
    - `Production`
    - `Testing`

---

### **3. Launch AWS Control Tower**
1. Navigate to the **AWS Control Tower** service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Select **Set up landing zone**.
3. Follow the guided wizard:
    - **Step 1: Permissions**: Grant AWS Control Tower the required permissions.
    - **Step 2: Region Selection**: Choose the home region for Control Tower.
    - **Step 3: Configuration**:
        - **Log Archive Account**: Specify or create an account for centralized logging.
        - **Audit Account**: Specify or create an account for security and compliance.
    - **Step 4: Governance**: Review and enable guardrails (e.g., service control policies) to enforce security and compliance across accounts.

---

### **4. Create Organizational Units (OUs)**
1. Use AWS Control Tower to define OUs based on your environment needs (e.g., `Sandbox`, `Production`).
2. Apply appropriate guardrails to OUs, such as:
    - Mandatory encryption of data at rest.
    - Restrictions on account creation.

---

### **5. Provision AWS Sandbox Accounts**
Use AWS Control Tower's **Account Factory** to provision sandbox accounts under the `Sandbox` OU.

1. Navigate to **Account Factory** in the AWS Control Tower dashboard.
2. Click **Enroll account** or **Provision account**.
3. Specify the following:
    - **Account Name**: A unique name for the sandbox account (e.g., `Sandbox-Dev-1`).
    - **Email Address**: Use a unique email address for each account.
    - **Organizational Unit**: Assign the `Sandbox` OU.
    - **IAM Role**: Optionally configure custom roles.

AWS Control Tower automates the provisioning process, applying the required governance and guardrails.

---

### **6. Configure Single Sign-On (SSO)**
AWS Control Tower integrates with AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) to provide seamless access to accounts.

1. Navigate to **AWS Single Sign-On** in the Management Console.
2. Assign users or groups to sandbox accounts with appropriate IAM policies.
3. Test access to ensure users can log in and perform actions in the sandbox environment.

---

### **7. Configure Centralized Logging and Monitoring**
1. **CloudTrail**: Automatically configured by Control Tower to send logs to the Log Archive account.
2. **AWS Config**: Enable AWS Config rules for compliance monitoring.
3. **Amazon CloudWatch**: Use dashboards and alarms for monitoring.

---

### **8. Customize with Customizations for AWS Control Tower (CFCT)**
If additional configurations are required:
1. Use **Customizations for AWS Control Tower (CFCT)** to deploy custom templates and policies.
2. Use AWS CloudFormation StackSets to deploy infrastructure and policies to sandbox accounts.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **Secure Multi-Account Setup**: Uses AWS best practices for security, compliance, and governance.
2. **Scalable Account Provisioning**: Automatically provisions new accounts with guardrails.
3. **Integrated Logging and Monitoring**: Centralizes logs for compliance and operational visibility.

---

## **Best Practices**
- **Naming Convention**: Use consistent naming for OUs and accounts (e.g., `Sandbox-Dev`, `Sandbox-Test`).
- **Guardrails**: Regularly review and update guardrails to reflect evolving security requirements.
- **Budget Controls**: Set up AWS Budgets to monitor and control costs in sandbox accounts.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Test account provisioning and guardrails with a sandbox account.
2. Regularly review AWS Control Towerâ€™s governance reports for compliance and performance insights.
3. Expand the landing zone to include additional OUs, accounts, or custom configurations as needed.
