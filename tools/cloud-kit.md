# Steve's Cloud Kit

I lead a lot of work sessions and demos, and I get asked what the tools are that
people see in these sessions. Here is a summary of my current cloud kit.
There are too many free tools to list, and that is probably a good topic for
another note with the top 20 free tools, but these are tools I purchase. 
Many of the companies I've worked for pay for some or all of this, but I 
maintain a kit like this myself because I am generally working on other
ventures and open source projects (except at McKinsey where that was forbidden).
As a nod to McKinsey though they provided all of this and more.
